(Powered by Libpcap/WinPcap and Emscripten.)

* Install Emscripten ([Windows offline installer](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) is the most convenient way, in Linux you have to compile it from sources)
* Download latest available [WinPcap source code](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm) and extract folder winpcap to the repo root
* Open Emscripten Command Prompt and run build.cmd

Done! You can now open build/bpf-test.html page or run some of the example unit tests (TODO).
